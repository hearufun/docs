<Warning>
Deleting a voice that is currently assigned to AI agents will cause those agents to fall back to the default system voice. Consider updating agent configurations before deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
Voice deletion is permanent. The cloned voice model and all associated audio samples will be removed from the system.
</Note>

## Agent Impact

When a voice is deleted, any agents using that voice will be automatically updated:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Agent has no fallback configured | Uses system default voice |
| Agent has fallback voice configured | Uses fallback voice |
| Voice in processing state | Deletion cancels processing |
