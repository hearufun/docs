<Warning>
This operation is **irreversible**. All documents, embeddings, and search history will be permanently deleted. Make sure to backup any important data before deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
If the knowledge base is currently assigned to any AI agents, you must first remove it from those agents before deletion. Use the [Agent Configuration](/api-reference/agents/update) endpoint to update agent settings.
