title: 'Cancel Transfer'
api: 'POST https://api.talkos.io/api/transfer/{callUuid}/cancel'
description: 'Cancel an in-progress transfer request'
---

## Overview

Cancels a pending or in-progress transfer request before it's accepted by an agent. When cancelled, the caller is returned to the AI assistant or placed in a queue based on your configuration. This endpoint is useful for handling timeout situations or when the caller's needs change during the transfer process.

## Cancellation Flow

```
Transfer Initiated → [Cancel Requested] → Cancelled
        ↓
    Ringing Agents → [Cancel Requested] → Cancelled → Return to AI
        ↓
    Agent Accepts → Cannot Cancel (use complete/reject instead)
```
