## Notes

<Warning>
**This action is irreversible.** All voice samples and verification history will be permanently deleted. The caller will need to re-enroll to use voice biometrics again.
</Warning>

<Info>
Deleting a voice profile may be required for GDPR compliance when a user requests data erasure. See the [GDPR Erasure](/api-reference/compliance/gdpr-erasure) endpoint for automated compliance handling.
</Info>

<Tip>
Consider using profile suspension instead of deletion if you may need to restore the profile later. Contact support for profile suspension options.
