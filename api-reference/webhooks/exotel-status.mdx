title: "Exotel Status Callback"
api: "POST https://api.talkos.io/api/calls/exotel/status"
description: "Webhook for Exotel call status updates"
---

This webhook receives call status updates from Exotel. It handles both call answered events and terminal events (call ended, failed, etc.).

<Note>
This endpoint is called by Exotel's servers, not by your application directly. Configure this URL as the Status Callback URL in your Exotel application.
</Note>

## Response

TalkOS always returns a JSON acknowledgment:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## Event Handling

### Answered Event (`EventType: answered`)

When a call is answered:
1. TalkOS registers the call if not already tracked
2. Call state is updated to "answered"
3. Audio streaming begins for AI conversation

### Terminal Event (`EventType: terminal`)

When a call ends:
1. Post-call processing is triggered
2. Analytics are computed
3. Transcripts are saved
4. Client webhooks are notified

## Inbound Call Detection

Similar to Plivo, if the `To` number is a registered TalkOS bot number, the call is treated as inbound and configured accordingly.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL (Answered Event)
curl -X POST https://api.talkos.io/api/calls/exotel/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
