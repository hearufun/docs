Delete the current database configuration and re-seed from environment variables. This resets all configuration to the original `.env` defaults.

<Warning>
This action will delete all custom configuration changes and reset to the values defined in your `.env` file. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.talkos.io/api/config/reset \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key"
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 200
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Config reset to .env defaults",
  "version": 1,
  "resetAt": "2026-02-17T15:00:00.000Z"
}
```

```json 500
{
  "error": "Config reset failed: Failed to seed from environment"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Notes

- This deletes the existing config document from the database
- A new config is seeded from the server's `.env` file
- The config version resets to 1
- This affects the current worker immediately; other workers sync on their next interval
- Use with caution in production environments
